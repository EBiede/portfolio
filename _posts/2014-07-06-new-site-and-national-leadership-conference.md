## Adams Central FBLA
Welcome to the new Adams Central FBLA News Site.  This site will be used to spread news about Local FBLA Events, News from the State, Regional, and National Levels, and to Share FBLA Documents with Members for Easy Access

###NLC Attendees
6 Members recently returned from Nashville, TN, where they attended the National Leadership Conference, along with 10,000 other FBLA members nationwide. In addition to partaking in the test/performance event they qualified in, they toured the Grand Ole Opry, took a riverboat cruise where they enjoyed great food and an amazing performance by the Crew, and Swingdanced at the Wild Horse Saloon (Some better than others).  Overall it was a great experience for all the students that attended.
