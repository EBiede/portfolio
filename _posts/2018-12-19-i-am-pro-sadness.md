description: Why Sadness is a Part of Life
---

Imagine a future in which every person on earth has a device where they can press a button to release hormones into their brain to make them instantly happy. Over time, these become insufficient to make anyone happy as they begin to adjust to this new norm, but they canâ€™t quit because now normal life feels like depression. This leaves everyone in a constant state of drugged up mediocre feelings.   
   
Happiness is all relative. In Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie is elated to be given a chocolate bar, but Veruca Salt is never satiated by any of her gifts she demands. In general, being sad is not an enjoyable state, but it is a necessary one. As we ride the roller coaster of life, there would be no amazing free falls, without valleys to climb out of. So, just take time to enjoy both parts of the ride.
